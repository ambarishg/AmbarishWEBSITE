Filled with hashtag#gratitude and hashtag#humility for winning the Research Challenge of the hashtag#Geospatial Hackathon organized by hashtag#SurveyofIndia , hashtag#IIITHyderabad, hashtag#Microsoft. This is one of a hackathon which ran for more than 4 months of idea , hackathon and final selection. One of the most striking things about this hackathon is (1) 3 organizations have collaborated and shown very active interest in this hackathon (2) After the results were declared, I had a 1 on 1 call with the Survey of India on how we can take the solution for the hashtag#nation good. Spent one of the most gratifying moments in hashtag#IITHyderabad and was amazed at the energy of hashtag#innovation and hashtag#enterpreneurship in the campus.

The solution was the Socio Economic Hub which shows lots of socio economic indicators for certain states at the Village Level, Assembly level and at the Parliamentary level. hashtag#SpatialDataConflation was used so that Parliamentary and Assembly constituency data is overlayed on the village level data to produce data at the Parliamentary and Assembly level. 

My best wishes to all the participants for this wonderful hackathon and looking forward for your best wishes as always as we continue to use our gift of using hashtag#technology for building the nation.Gratitude again to hashtag#SurveyofIndia , hashtag#IIITHyderabad, hashtag#Microsoft
