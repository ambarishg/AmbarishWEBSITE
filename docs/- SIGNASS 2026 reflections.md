- SIGNASS 2026 reflections  
- The 2026 conference convened industry, healthcare, and academic practitioners to reflect on applied signal processing. This page highlights the Session Chair role and links it to the separate panel discussion summary below where the panelists reflected on real-world signal intelligence challenges.  

- A sustained focus on deployment-ready signal intelligence  
- The Domain-Aware AI/ML for Real-World Signal Processing panel blended insights across healthcare, communication, and the power sector.  

- Contributions  
- Session Chair for the Domain-Aware AI/ML for Real-World Signal Processing: Healthcare and Communication Perspectives track, keeping the dialogue aligned to deployment realities, ethical guardrails, and measurable signal outcomes.  
- Industry panelist throughout the panel, addressing the themes covering data preparation effort, generative AI use cases, and reliability/security trade-offs.  

- Panel discussion summary  
- The panel focused on Domain-Aware AI/ML for real-world signal processing across healthcare, communication, and power systems. Conversation tracks explored commercial signal-driven solutions, the trade-offs between data preparation and modeling, uses of generative AI for signal synthesis and anomaly detection, considerations for reliability/security with a human-in-the-loop, and how academia can better support industry over the next 5-10 years.  

List items:  
1. Commercial adoption, sector-specific acceleration, and signal-driven AI solutions formed the opening theme.  
2. The “signal-to-system” reality check emphasised the disproportionate effort spent on cleaning and preprocessing.  
3. Generative AI discussions highlighted signal synthesis, anomaly detection, and automation pipelines in industry.  
4. Reliability, security, governance, and trust prompted reflections on human oversight for mission-critical systems.  
5. The closing theme surfaced future expectations from academia, especially around deployment readiness of domain-aware AI.
